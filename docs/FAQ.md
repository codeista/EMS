# Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

### What exactly is this system?
It's a collection of Google Forms, Sheets, and Sites that work together to manage school events. Think of it as a free alternative to expensive event management software, built using tools your school already has.

### How much does it cost?
**$0** - completely free. It uses Google Workspace for Education which schools get free. No hidden fees, subscriptions, or purchases required.

### How long does setup take?
**2-3 hours** for initial setup if you follow the Quick Start Checklist. After that, about 1-2 hours per week during event season.

### Do I need to be technical?
No coding required. If you can use Google Docs and follow a checklist, you can set this up. The most "technical" part is copying and pasting one email script.

## Technical Questions

### Can we use personal Gmail accounts?
**For coordinators**: Yes, but school accounts work better (higher email limits)  
**For vendors/volunteers**: Yes, any email address works

### What are the email limits?
- Personal Gmail: 100 emails per day
- School Google Workspace: 1,500 emails per day
- The system sends maybe 5-20 emails per day typically

### Can multiple people manage it?
Yes! Add as many coordinators as needed. Everyone can access the dashboard and help manage the event.

### Does it work on phones?
Yes, everything is mobile-friendly. Vendors, volunteers, and coordinators can all use phones.

### What if Google is down?
Google has 99.9% uptime. In the extremely rare case of downtime, you can:
- Access cached data on phones
- Use printed backups (which you should have anyway)
- Wait a few minutes - outages are typically very brief

## Setup Questions

### We don't have Google Workspace. Can we still use this?
You need Google Workspace for Education (free for schools). If your school doesn't have it:
1. Apply at [edu.google.com](https://edu.google.com) - it's free
2. Or use personal Gmail accounts (with some limitations)
3. Or adapt the templates for Microsoft 365

### Can we customize everything?
Yes! Every form, email, and page can be modified. Common customizations:
- Different stall prices
- Modified shift times
- Additional form fields
- Custom branding
- Different event types

### Can we use it for events other than markets?
Absolutely! It works for:
- School fairs
- Sports days
- Concerts
- Fundraising events
- Any event needing vendor/volunteer coordination

### What if we already use another system?
You can:
- Run both in parallel initially
- Import existing vendor lists to Google Sheets
- Gradually transition volunteers
- Export data anytime if you want to switch back
