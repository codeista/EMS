- No setup required, works immediately
- Free to use

**Option 2: School Google Workspace Domain**
- Format: `sites.google.com/[school-domain]/[site-name]`
- Only if school has Google Workspace
- Requires admin setup

**Option 3: Custom Domain (e.g., www.schoolmarket.co.nz)**
- Requires purchasing domain name
- Needs Google Workspace or Google Sites subscription
- Must configure DNS settings
- Most professional appearance
